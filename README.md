!!WELCOME!!

In order to run the app, follow these three instructions.

1. Install Dependencies:

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory (where the package.json file is located).
Run "npm install" to install all the project's dependencies, including Express for the proxy server.


2. Start the Proxy Server

In the same terminal, run "node server.js".
This will start the proxy server listening on port 3001.

3. Start the React App

Open a new terminal window in the same project directory.
Run npm start to start the React development server.
The React app will typically open in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.


P.S. I have left the API key in the app the dev doing the review doesn't have to mess with that, will be removed on 01.06.2024.
